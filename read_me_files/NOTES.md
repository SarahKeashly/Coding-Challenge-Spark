Please leave any additional notes you have here.


Unfortunately, I got stuck on reporting out the incomplete contacts.  I was able to report them originally when I had not separated everything out into methods.  

I also could not figure out how to get my next if guard to work once I separated out everything into methods for testing.  

I was able to get two of the methods to pass tests. 

Moving forward, to map out the questions and associate them with the answers I would probably have created a loop to print out the header row (row[0]) and then created another loop go through the other rows so that it would print out the header row and then the next row underneath it.
